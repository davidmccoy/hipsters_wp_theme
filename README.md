Wordpress theme for [Hipsters of the Coast](http://www.hipstersofthecoast.com).

Required plugins:

- [WP User Avatar](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-user-avatar/) in order to display author avatars and use the `get_wp_user_avatar_src` function.
- [Highlight and Share](https://wordpress.org/plugins/highlight-and-share/) to allow users to highlight text and share it.
- [Insert Post Ads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-post-ads/) to insert ads into posts (and use the same structure to manually add to homepage via `functions.php`)
- [Jetpack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) for infinite scroll.
- [Related Posts for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/related-posts-for-wp/), though we use an edited version of the premium version.
